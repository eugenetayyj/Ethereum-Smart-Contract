# Ethereum Smart Contract
An Ethereum Smart Contract that provides the basic CRUD operations. 
The aim of this smart contract is to store information on a blockchain due to the security from using consensus mechanisms.
The smart contract can be accessed through dedicated text editors or online IDE like https://remix.https://remix.ethereum.org/.
Have fun looking through its processes!
